pyJasper - a set of python based tools to handle JasperReports.
Since jasper reports is a Java application you need Java installed. You also need Jython to access 
the JasperReports library.

frontend.py                    - contains high-level Python functions for report generation. Should 
                                 theoretically be able to work with report generators other than
                                 JasperReports. So far builds on JasperClient.py.
JasperClient.py                - Renders a Report with JasperReports either via starting a shell script
                                 or via connecting to a server.
JasperClientTest.py            - guess what! Needs pmock from http://pmock.sourceforge.net/
                               
backend/                       - contains tools to drive JasperReports and actually build reports 
                                 (PDF only at the Moment) The backend was once based on XmlJasperInterface 
                                 by Jonas Schwertfeger but hase benn moving away from it for some time.
backend/JasperServer.py        - 
backend/JasperServer.sh
backend/XmlJasperInterface.py  - driving jasper reports to generate PDFs. Also a command line application
                                 to generate reports.
backend/XmlJasperInterface.sh  - shell script to start XmlJasperInterface.py
backend/JasperServerTest.py    -

backend/reports                - report source files (*.jrxml)
backend/compiled-reports       - compiled report files (*.jasper)
backend/sample-xml             - sample XML files to work with reports
backend/sample-pdf             - sample PDFs generated by using reports with sample XML
backend/lib                    - JasperReports and Jython Java Libraries
